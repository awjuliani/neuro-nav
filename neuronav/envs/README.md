# Benchmark Environments

A set of cognitive neuroscience inspired navigation and decision making tasks in environments with either graph or grid structures.

These environments support the default `gym` interface which is commonly used in open source reinforcement learning packages. You can learn more about gym [here](https://github.com/openai/gym).

## GridEnv

`GridEnv` consists of a simple 2D grid environment with various topographies and observation types.

### Topographies

The `GridEnv` class can generate a variety of different maze layouts by setting the topography. Below is a list of the topographies which are supported. Topographies can be set as an enum when initializing the environment. For example: 

```env = GridEnv(topography=GridTopography.empty)```

 To add your own topographies, edit [grid_topographies.py](./grid_topographies.py).

| Topography | Image Small (11x11) | Image Large (17 x 17)
| --- | --- | --- |
| empty | ![empty](/imgs/empty.png) | ![empty_large](/imgs/empty_large.png) |
| four_rooms | ![four_rooms](/imgs/four_rooms.png) | ![four_rooms_large](/imgs/four_rooms_large.png) |
| outer_ring | ![outer_ring](/imgs/outer_ring.png) | ![outer_ring_large](/imgs/outer_ring_large.png) |
| two_rooms| ![two_rooms](/imgs/two_rooms.png) | ![two_rooms_large](/imgs/two_rooms_large.png) |
| u_maze | ![u_maze](/imgs/u_maze.png) | ![u_maze_large](/imgs/u_maze_large.png) |

| i_maze | ![i_maze](/imgs/i_maze.png) | ![i_maze_large](/imgs/i_maze_large.png) |
| detour | ![detour](/imgs/detour.png) | ![detour_large](/imgs/detour_large.png) |
| detour_block | ![detour_block](/imgs/detour_block.png) | ![detour_block_large](/imgs/detour_block_large.png) |

### Observation Types

The `GridEnv` class also supports a variety of observation types for the agent. These vary in the amount of information provided to the agent, and in their format. 

Observation types can be set as an enum when initializing the environment. For example: 

```env = GridEnv(obs_type=GridObsType.index)```

To add your own, edit [grid_env.py](./grid_env.py).

| Observation | Type | Shape (Fixed Orientation) | Shape (Dynamic Orientation) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index | Tabular | `[1]` | `[1]` | An integer number representing the current state of the agent in the environment. |
| onehot | Function-Approx | `[n * n]` | `[n * n * 4]` | A one-hot encoding of the current state of the agent in the environment. |
| twohot | Function-Approx | `[n + n]` | `[n + n + 4]` | Two concatenated one-hot encodings of the agent's x and y coordinates in the environment. |
| geometric | Function-Approx | `[2]` | `[3]` | Two real-valued numbers between 0 and 1 representing the x and y coordinates of the agent in the environment. |
| boundary | Function-Approx | `[n * 4]` | `[n * 4 + 4]` | A matrix corresponding to the one-hot encodings of the distances of the agent from the nearest wall in the four cardinal directions |
| visual | Function-Approx | `[n, n, 3]` | `[n, n, 3` | A 3D tensor corresponding to the RGB image of the environment. |
| images | Function-Approx | `[32, 32, 3]` | `[32, 32, 3` | A 3D tensor corresponding to a unique CIFAR10 image per state. |
| window | Function-Approx | `[5, 5, 3]` | `[5, 5, 3]` | A 3D tensor corresponding to the 5x5 local window around the agent. |

* Where `n` is the length of the grid.

## GraphEnv

`GraphEnv` consists of a simple graph environment with various layout structures and observation types. 

### Structures

Graph structures can be set as an enum when initializing the environment. For example: 

```env = GraphEnv(graph_structure=GraphStructure.neighborhood)```

The graph structures can be added to by editing [graph_structures.py](./graph_structures.py)

| Structure | Image |
| --- | --- |
| two_step | ![two_step](/imgs/two_step.png) |
| linear | ![linear](/imgs/linear.png) |
| t_graph | ![t_graph](/imgs/t_graph.png) |
| neighborhood | ![neighborhood](/imgs/neighborhood.png) |
| ring | ![ring](/imgs/ring_graph.png) |
| two_way_linear | ![two_way_linear](/imgs/two_way_linear.png) |

### Observation Types

The `GraphEnv` class also supports a variety of observation types for the agent. These vary in the amount of information provided to the agent, and in their format. 

Observation types can be set as an enum when initializing the environment. For example: 

```env = GraphEnv(obs_type=GraphObsType.index)```

To add your own, edit [graph_env.py](./graph_env.py).

| Observation | Type | Shape | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index | Tabular | `[1]` | An integer number representing the current state of the agent in the environment. |
| onehot | Function-Approx | `[n]` | A one-hot encoding of the current state of the agent in the environment. |
| images | Function-Approx | `[32, 32, 3]` | `[32, 32, 3` | A 3D tensor corresponding to a unique CIFAR10 image per state. |

* Where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.
