# Experiment Notebooks

Neuro-nav includes a number of interactive jupyter notebooks. These demonstrate features of the library, as well as serve to reproduce various experiments in the literature.

| Notebook | Description | Referenced Work | Animal Model | Colab Link |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- | --- |
| [Usage Tutorial](./usage_tutorial.ipynb) | This notebook provides a basic usage tutorial of both environment types. This is the best place to start for those seeking to understand the features of neuro-nav. | N/A | N/A | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/awjuliani/neuro-nav/blob/main/notebooks/usage_tutorial.ipynb) |
| [Successor Representation Experiments](./representation_experiments.ipynb) | Demonstrates how to generate visualizations of the learned representations from agents utilizing a successor representation. These include value maps, successor "place" cells, and successor "grid" cells. | [Stachenfeld et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4650) | Rodent |  [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/awjuliani/neuro-nav/blob/main/notebooks/representation_experiments.ipynb) |
| [Grid Transfer Experiments](./grid_experiments.ipynb) | Evaluates various algorithms ability to adapt to changes in reward location or environment structure in goal-directed navigation tasks. | [Russek et al., 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005768) | Rodent | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/awjuliani/neuro-nav/blob/main/notebooks/grid_experiments.ipynb) |
| Graph Transfer Experiments [(1)](./graph_experiments_1.ipynb) [(2)](./graph_experiments_2.ipynb) | Evaluates various algorithms ability to adapt to changes in reward contingencies or transition dynamics in decision making tasks. | [Momennejad et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8) | Human |  [Link (1)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/awjuliani/neuro-nav/blob/main/notebooks/graph_experiments_1.ipynb), [Link (2)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/awjuliani/neuro-nav/blob/main/notebooks/graph_experiments_2.ipynb) |
| [Temporal Community Experiments](./temporal_community.ipynb) | Compares methods for learning representations which display temporal community structure. Utilizes a graph environment with local neighborhood structure. | [Schapiro et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3331) | Human | [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/awjuliani/neuro-nav/blob/main/notebooks/temporal_community.ipynb) |
