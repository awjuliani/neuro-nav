# Experiment Notebooks

Neuro-nav includes a number of interactive jupyter notebooks. These demonstrate features of the library, as well as serve to reproduce various experiments in the literature.

| Notebook | Description | Colab Link | Referenced Work | Animal Model |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- | --- |
| [Usage Tutorial](./usage_tutorial.ipynb) | This notebook provides a basic usage tutorial of both environment types. This is the best place to start for those seeking to understand the features of neuro-nav. | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| [Successor Representation Experiments](./representation_experiments.ipynb) | Demonstrates how to generate visualizations of the learned representations from agents utilizing a successor representation. These include value maps, successor "place" cells, and successor "grid" cells. | N/A | [Stachenfeld et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4650) | Rodent |
| [Grid Transfer Experiments](./grid_experiments.ipynb) | Evaluates various algorithms ability to adapt to changes in reward location or environment structure in goal-directed navigation tasks. | N/A | [Russek et al., 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005768) | Rodent |
| Graph Transfer Experiments [(1)](./graph_experiments_1.ipynb) [(2)](./graph_experiments_2.ipynb) | Evaluates various algorithms ability to adapt to changes in reward contingencies or transition dynamics in decision making tasks. | N/A | [Momennejad et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8) | Human |
