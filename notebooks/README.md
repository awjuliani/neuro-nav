# Jupyter Notebooks

We include a number of interactive jupyter notebooks demonstrating various feature of the library, as well as reproducing known results.

* The [Usage tutorial notebook](./usage_tutorial.ipynb) includes a basic usage tutorial of both environment types. This is the best place to start for those seeking to understand the features of neuro-nav.

* The [Successor representation notebook](./representation_experiments.ipynb) demonstrates how to generate figures displaying learned representations from agents, such as value maps along with the successor "place" and "grid" cells presented in [Stachenfeld et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4650).

* The [Grid experiments notebook](./grid_experiments.ipynb) includes code to evaluate agents on a set of grid environment tasks inspired by [Russek et al., 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005768).

* The graph experiments notebooks: [(Experiment 1)](./graph_experiments_1.ipynb) and [(Experiment 2)](./graph_experiments_2.ipynb) include code to evaluate agents on graph tasks taken from [Momennejad et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8).
